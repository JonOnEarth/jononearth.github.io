I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University working with Professor [Mahdi Imani](https://imani.lab.northeastern.edu/). Current research focuses on Mixed Reality attacks, Multi-Agent/Robot collaboration and more, with an emphasis on critical themes such as security, privacy, and trustworthiness. This work intertwines concepts from machine learning, reinforcement learning and federated learning to address complex challenges in these domains.

Prior to this role, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Northeastern University, where I conducted research under the guidance of Professor [Pau Closas](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/closas-pau/). My doctoral work concentrated on advanced deep learning and Bayesian methods within Federated Learning, particularly applied to indoor positioning, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and image processing. Key areas of focus included Bayesian data fusion in Federated Learning, developing WiFi fingerprint-based solutions for indoor positioning and tracking, and enhancing GNSS signal processing to mitigate the risks of spoofing and jamming.

I also co-founded a startup as Chief Scientist, [Cactivate](www.cactivate.com), an AI-driven platform that optimizes and automates online advertising, specifically tailored for agencies and e-commerce businesses.

## Recent and past Research
In the current AI environment, where the technology’s pervasiveness is undeniable, the vital issues of data privacy, security, and equitable access require immediate attention. My current and future research efforts will focus on these concerns head-on through private, robust, equalable and interpretable Distributed Learning. These algorithms are carefully developed not only to meet the rigorous requirements of real-world applications but also to establish the foundation for Responsible AI—a paradigm in which AI systems are designed with accountability, transparency, and fairness at their core, ultimately resulting in more secure, inclusive, and trustworthy AI implementations.

**Bayesian Federated Learning Framework**: Compared to FL, Bayesian FL enhances FL by leveraging the benefits of Bayesian inference. By integrating prior knowledge and inferring parameter distributions, this approach effectively captures the intrinsic statistical heterogeneity of FL models, which facilitates the quantification of uncertainties and model dynamics. Consequently, it fosters the development of more robust and interpretable federated models. However, papers combining Bayesian FL with data association mechanisms are notably absent, especially in clustered FL.
By introducing this framework, I have laid the groundwork for a myriad of further investigations. The idea centralizes optimizing client-cluster associations within Federated Learning to gracefully handle non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, a commonplace in practical applications. My work delineates a methodical approach for balancing performance with computational complexity, setting the stage for enhanced models and innovative client knowledge-sharing methodologies. One of my papers delving into this matter is currently undergoing review for In Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024, and continuous efforts are underway to develop this concept further, such as incorporating a random number of clusters for optimization.

**Robust Bayesian Data Fusion Framework**: The designed framework optimizes fusion accuracy while honoring privacy constraints and offers profound insights into distributed learning. Presenting a meticulous analysis of shared priors impact within Bayesian data fusion settings, published in Transactions on Signal Processing extends our understanding of distributed frameworks under a Bayesian lens, providing interpretability for Distributed Learning and Federated Learning systems.

**Data Driven Machine Learning**: Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken several machine learning projects that focus on indoor positioning, integrating machine learning methodologies and tracking algorithms to refine WiFi fingerprinting and tracking systems. This work has culminated in three peer-reviewed publications. In parallel, my endeavors in GNSS applications have led to groundbreaking data-driven methodologies that eclipse traditional strategies, particularly evident in GNSS signal acquisition, deep learning-based spoofing detection, and intricate modeling of multipath effects on GNSS correlation outputs. These collaborative efforts have resulted in over six published papers. 

**Application to Real-world Problems**: 
(1) Jammer Signal Classification: Addressing threats to GNSS operations, this application of Federated Learning for jamming signal classification safeguards data privacy while training robust, accurate classifiers. This groundbreaking work, which claimed the best paper award at ION PLANS 2023, takes significant strides in privacy-preserving collaborative learning.
(2) Indoor Localization: I have explored personalized Federated Learning and model reliability with dropout to tackle the challenges of non-IID data for indoor localization, with outcomes indicating significant improvements over traditional techniques, charting a path closer to centralized learning effectiveness.

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
